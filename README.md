# House-Price-Predictor
This House Price Predictor is a Machine Learning Model written in Python that uses Linear Regression for analyzing current house prices and forecasting the future prices according to the userâ€™s requirements.It takes  18 inputs such as No. of Bedrooms,No of Bathrooms,Sq ft Area etc and predicts the house price.The model has been trained using USA_Housing_dataset.A number of data cleaning methods are deployed before fitting the model.The model has been integrated with a flask frontend.
The following inputs are required:

1. date: Date the house was sold
2. price: Price is the prediction target
3. bedrooms: Number of Bedrooms/House
4. bathrooms: Number of bathrooms/bedrooms
5. sqft_living: Square footage of the home

7. floors: Total floors (levels) in the house
8. waterfront: House which has a view to a waterfront
9. view: Has been viewed
10.condition: How good the condition is Overall
11.sqft_above: Square footage of house apart from basement
12.sqft_basement: Square footage of the basement
13.yr_built: Year the house was built
14.yr_renovated: Year when house was renovated
15.street: Street name of the house
16.city: City in which the house isPage | 6
17.statezip: State zip code
18.country: Country in which the house is

The project helps you understand the correlation between the different attributes and the house price.It makes use of visualizations and plots making it easier to identify trends.The accuracy of this model is found by callculating RMSE (Root mean square error) and MAE(Mean Absolute Error)
